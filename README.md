Introduction
The system design of the Emergency Vehicle Identification System outlines the 
architecture, components, and workflow for real-time detection and traffic management. It 
integrates CCTV cameras, a YOLOv8 object detection model, and a traffic control 
system to identify and prioritize emergency vehicles. The CCTV cameras capture live 
traffic footage, which is processed by the Emergency Vehicle Detection System. The 
YOLOv8 model detects emergency vehicles and generates bounding boxes around them. 
Upon detection, the system sends alerts to traffic authorities, who can adjust traffic 
signals dynamically. The design ensures real-time processing, automation, and scalability. 
A database stores detection logs for monitoring and future analysis. The user interface 
provides a dashboard for traffic authorities to track vehicles. The system is optimized for 
efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability to different urban environments.
